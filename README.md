# Genshin Artifacts Helper

This is a program providing some utilities for artifacts management in Genshin Impact.

Currently it supports right-click to deselect an artifacts in the enhancement view.

Use this at your own risk. You probably won't get banned, as we are only moving the mouse, and it is no causing any harm for Mihoyo in any way.


## Getting Started
1. Start Genshin Impact game
2. Download the release exe file. Run it, and accept admin rights.
3. Open up the "enchance" page of any artifacts
3. Press `Ctrl + P`, to enable the helper. A panel should show up in the lower left corner of the game
4. Press `Right click` to disable any selected artifacts

To exit the app, press `Alt + Q` or in the __tray menu__ right click on the icon and __Exit__.

## Note
It needs admin rights as mihoyo has anti-cheat system to prevent scripts controlling the mouse controls.
